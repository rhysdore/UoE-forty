Throughout this section, I have provided both the outputs of the assessments, as well as reflections regarding my learning throughout the course.

***Group Assessment***

My personal coding contribution was particularly the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zyuZx6zAjayZt9eTY40mjPIqvF4j1508?usp=sharing">clustering analysis</a>

Group project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_4zgbURvNXEVo_1DNGpO1tQl8OjctwsE/view?usp=sharing">complete code</a>

Group project <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zoZzCc0VgbmQX-RgFbTCjY8OfVRjbBi8cvsQZ_YYey8/edit?usp=sharing">final report</a>

See Meeting Notes for further notes taken during group meetings.

***Reflections on the Collaborative Discussions***

I have enjoyed participating in these collaborative discussions and this has been vital for considering the socioethical considerations related to AI and its advancements. Whilst I believe that I have provided insightful commentary, I have also found novel and innovative discussion points raised by my collagues on the course. I have responded appropriately to those particularly intruiging concepts, and have learnt about the importance of having diverse voices when discussing such a complex topic. In the future, I will continue to highlight the importance of widespread multidisciplinary discussions to enhance understanding and collaboration within the field.

***Unit 1***

This was an introductory component which provided a broad overview of AI and machine learning. 

***Unit 2***

During this section I learnt about exploratory data analysis. I already felt well-versed within this considering I undertake this form of analysis as part of my research frequently. However, the key area for learning was regarding using Python rather than R. Python also seemed relatively simple for this aspect, but it did indeed take my some time to get used to Google Colab and integrate Python via Visual Studio Code. 

***Unit 3***

I particularly enjoy statistics and understanding the statistical background of testing that we undertake. Therefore, I was excited to learn more about regression and co-efficients. Whilst I was well acquainted with Pearson, linear, and multiple linear regression analyses, the concept of polynomial regression was new to me. I have since read more into this area, considering the utility of undertaking non-linear regression analyses. However, I recognise that one would require reasonable insight into the theoretical true underlying data structure for this to be appropriate.

***Unit 4***

This involved more practical application of the regression information learnt in the previous section. I found that the provided code was extremely useful, and that it akways makes sense to build off of effective base code rather than writing everything fresh. I was particularly intrigued by the use of non-linear regression, and the way in which the model was able to fit so well to this data. I will therefore be planning to utilise this technique in the future within my research for biological data.

***Unit 5 & 6***

I found the wiki activity really interesting because I was excited to learn more about clustering. This is a technique which is frequently used in bioinformatics in terms of single-cell analysis. I also focussed on the use of clustering within my group project, and this helped immensely with ensuring that the work was undertaken effectively. I did not appreciate that there were so many parameters that went into clustering, and one key aspect was regarding the fact that clusters are not necessarily completely agnostic of expected understanding of the data (i.e. having to set the expected number of clusters for most models).
	
***Unit 7 & 8***

I have previously not undertaken any work on artificial neural networks, and therefore this was my first introduction to the topic. I found the explanations extremely useful, and the variabilty of hyperparameters somewhat overwhelming at first. Demonstrative code for both simple and more complex perceptrons was extremely useful and helped me to understand the ways in which this information can be layered. In the future, I would like to understand more of the mathematics that underlies this model preparation and therefore I am planning to undertake a course in theoretical neuroscience with machine learning which will delve further into this. This section also focused on the actual training of the networks, which is a vital component of machine learning. I feel like I gained a much better understanding of backpropogation, yet, as above, would like to understand more of the underlying mathematics here. It was also enlightening to understand more about the impact that artificial neural networks have had within different areas of society. In healthcare, there are increasing attempts to utilise these neural networks for the assessment of patient data, however many of these remain in their infancy. Therefore, I plan to keep a keen eye on developments within the field.

***Unit 9 & 10***

This section involved learning about convolutional neural networks. There are increasingly prevalent in healthcare considering their application to computer vision, and thus their role in asepcts such as radiology and pathology. Notably, this was also particularly important for completion of the final assessment considering that this depended on building a model that could interpret image data. I ensured to include convolutional blocks within my final models. I recognised that there were a range of activation functions and hyperparameters that related to setting up this kind of model, and found these interesting to alter. I have initial difficulty in writing code which would work for this model, but found the provision of example code extremely helpful. I would like to continue practising to write code for models such as this in the future to improve my work.

***Unit 11***

Obviously, one of the most important aspects of model creation is assessment of the model. This section taught mee many important things to consider in the asssessment. However, one difficulty faced is running a large assessment of multiple models when restricted by compute. In the future I would aim to use a server or high performance computer. I would like to have integrated more of this assessment information into my final assessment, and will plan to learn futher about these assessment methods in the future. 

***Unit 12***

Considering the future of AI, I have strong personal beliefs that AI will become commonplace and will be effectively integrated into our ordinary lives. Reading about Industry 4.0 and the purported integration and dependence which will be expected is enlightening but not necessarily surprising. I believe there are reasonable concerns regardings jobs and aspects such as AI hallucinations in generative work. Considering I work in the research field, I believe that research is occurring at a vast past, and considering the explosion of AI this is not always based purely on quality, but sometimes on quantity of work or new models which can be achieved. I will continue to pay attention to new publications within the AI field as well as new releases from key stakeholders within AI.
