Introductions

Writing up an initial contract of working together. Descriptive shared group plan provided by Abdul. Decision made to ensure that Task 1 is undertaken by all members, and then the following takes to be shared between members.

Plan:
Rhys to send contract to Liz.
All members to develop ideas regarding the initial question
 
 
**Meeting 18/11/23 (1 hour)**
 
Attending: all

Discussion regarding the various questions that could be chosen.

Abdul: Highlighting that price or reviews could be used as dependent outcome. Noting the importance of ensuring that the answer is useful in a business analytical decision for AirBnB. Highlighted that certain unsupervised models can indeed be predictive.

Ahmed: Suggestions regarding the use of association rules as an unsupervised machine learning technique. Explained that we should undertake some exploratory data analysis before confirming a question.

Rhys: Feels number of reviews has many confounders, and price would be better to use. Argument for business idea would be that AirBnb could advise on pricing for hosts. Feels that we could split work into EDA, a supervised model, and an undersupervised model and each do one part.

Preliminary question agree upon during meeting: ‘What are the most important characteristics that influence the price of an AirBnB property?’

Plan:
Ahmed to form initial EDA
